 <h1 style="color:;"> Aspirations</h1>
<p>I have always wanted to learn to code, and thought to myself if I didn't go down the traditional creative route I would've pursued computer science because I really remember enjoying those lessons in high school as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  By the end of this course I would really like to try my hand at becoming a UX designer and maybe know how to create basic games (Ikno thats a different course;P but why not?)

  <br>
  I am quite interested in making an app or website that can help people get organized, increase productivity or just help in day to day life. </p>
